## JOTTO GAME - Test Driven Development
- I'm learning TDD with this React application.
- I'm writing Unit and Functional Tests using `Jest` and `Jasmine`.
- Approach followed - Plan, Test and then Code
- Planning the feature to be developed.
- Writing Tests, watching the tests fail.
- And then coding so that we have passing tests.

### Dependancies used for testing
-  `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`
-  `check-prop-types`
-  `enzyme`
-  `moxios`

This project is built using `create-react-app`
Run `npm install` to get started
Run `npm start` to run locally
